Description: his package applies a Random Forest-based bias correction method to satellite-derived environmental data, such as precipitation, temperature, and other relevant meteorological or environmental variables. The model corrects biases in these satellite products by incorporating in-situ measurements and environmental covariates, including the Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
