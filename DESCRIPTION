Description: Implements a bias correction method that combines Random Forest models with Quantile Mapping to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived environmental datasets. The model corrects biases in meteorological variables, such as precipitation and temperature, by integrating in situ measurements and a Digital Elevation Model (DEM).
